		<p>Our founder, Bruce the shark, came from the deep ocean blue. After being featured in Disney-Pixar's Finding Nemo in 2003, Bruce wanted a bigger and better life. Following through on his words:</p>
		
		<p style="margin: 0 5%; font-style:italic;">“I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food.”</p>

		<p> So he left his home in the ocean to reinvent himself as a Juice Master and successfullly started Bruce's Juices in 2020. Since Finding Nemo came out, Bruce founded and built up our sister private investigator company: Bruce Deduces. </p>

		<p>Bruce's goal is to help his fellow shark friends and relatives complete the transition to life outside the ocean. 200% of the proceeds generated by Bruce's Juices will go to the Sharks Above Water Foundation (SAW) and every 1000 drinks purchased can help a shark make the move.</p>

		<p>As Bruce's friends and family make their way to the wonderful land above the horizon, they create new <a href="recipes.html">recipes</a> and help us run different Bruce's Juices <a href="locations.html">locations</a> around the world. Our flavors are originals and every year, we turn one of your suggestions into a new flavor.</p>
