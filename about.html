		<h1>About Bruce's Juices</h1>
		<h2>Bruce the Shark</h2>
		<p>Our founder, Bruce the shark, came from the deep ocean blue. After being featured in Disney-Pixar's <a href="https://movies.disney.com/finding-nemo">Finding Nemo</a> documentary in 2003, Bruce wanted a bigger and better life. Following through on his words:</p>
		
		<p style="margin: 0 5%; font-style:italic;">“I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food.”</p>

		<p>So he left his home in the ocean to reinvent himself as a Juice Master and successfullly started Bruce's Juices in 2020. Since Finding Nemo came out, Bruce founded and built up our sister private investigator company: Bruce Deduces.</p>

		<h2>Bruce's Mission</h2>
		<p>Bruce's goal is to help his fellow shark friends and relatives complete the transition to life outside the ocean. 200% of the proceeds generated by Bruce's Juices will go to the Sharks Above Water Foundation (SAW) and every 1000 drinks purchased can help a shark make the move.</p>

		<p>As Bruce's friends and family make their way to the wonderful land above the horizon, they create new <a href="recipes.html">recipes</a> and help us run different Bruce's Juices <a href="info.html#locations">locations</a> around the world. Our flavors are originals and every couple months, we turn one of your suggestions into a new flavor.</p>

		<p>For those sharks that still live in the ocean, Bruce hopes to reduce the stigma surrounding sharks as a threat to humans. They are nothing to be scared of, and humans don’t get hurt by them very often at all!</p>

		<h2>More About Bruce's Juices</h2>
		<p>When asked why he decided to start a juice company, Bruce said “It just felt right! There are so many different types of fruit on land that humans seem to take for granted! Imagine being a shark for a second - you need to chase all of your food, and the stuff that does sit still - seaweed, clams, crabs, etc, are gross and unfilling! The other sharks really don’t know what they’re missing out on. Fruits are like fish just sitting on trees and bushes, waiting to be eaten without a care!”</p>

		<p>Bruce’s Juices has come a long way since its conception. Company legend has it that in just February, our only flavors were Sandy Sour and Dirty Delicacy! Bruce and his associates quickly realized, however, that humans were not interested in these flavors, and moved on to fruits with more nutritional value.</p>

		<p>Bruce makes strides towards understanding humans every single day. He has developed an unlikely friendship with a person named Ezekiel, and they communicate through a complex combination of fin/arm movements and a modification of morse code based on breathing rate.</p>

		<p>Fans have also wondered how Bruce manages to breathe and walk on land. The truth is, no one knows! He may truly be a miracle (or maybe he just drinks a lot of juice).</p>
